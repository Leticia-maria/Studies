In JS, we can declare variables in three different ways, using the following _keywords_:

- **var** : This keyword is used to declare a variable globally (In this case, the variable is changeable); 
> Recommendation: if the codes get huge, then you'll get confused.

- **let** : This keyword is used to declare variable locally. If you used thus keyword to declare variable then the variable can accessible locally and it is changeable as well. It is good if the code gets huge. 

- **const** : This keyword is used to declare variable locally. If yo use this keyword to declare a variable then the variable will only be accessible within that block similar to the variable defined by using let and difference between **let** and **const** is that the variables declared by using **const** values can't be ressigned.
