## Dictionaries in JS

JS Object type offers us enough flexibility to store data as key-value pairs as a standard dictionary does. Object type also supports accessing stored data using keys, iteracting through keys and values, and even using different data types as keys.

Example:

```javascript
let dict = {
   id: 123,
   name: 'Anj',
   age: 20,
   registered: true
}
```
